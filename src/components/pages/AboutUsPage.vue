        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The site was launched in November 2004 by Garrett Gyssler and maintained solely by him until 2008. 
            Originally, the website was called AnimeList, but Gyssler decided to incorporate the possessive "My"
            at the beginning, following the fashion of the most important social network in those years: Myspace.
            On August 4, 2008, CraveOnline, a men's entertainment and lifestyle site owned by AtomicOnline, purchased 
            MyAnimeList for an undisclosed sum of money. In 2015, DeNA announced that it had purchased MyAnimeList 
            from CraveOnline, and that they would partner with Anime Consortium Japan to stream anime on the service, via Daisuki.
            MyAnimeList announced in April 2016 that they had embed episodes from Crunchyroll and Hulu directly onto the site,
            with over 20,000 episodes being made available on the site.
            On September 25, 2019, HIDIVE and MyAnimeList announced a partnership which would incorporate MyAnimeList's content ratings
            into HIDIVE's streaming platform, while exclusively providing MyAnimeList users with a curated selection of embedded HIDIVE content for free.
            On February 18, 2021, MyAnimeList announced Kodansha, Shueisha and Shogakukan have started investing in MAL.
            In October 2021, MyAnimeList collaborated with e-book publisher Media Do to release Fist of the North Star Manga 
            Fragments: Dying Like a Man, a series of non-fungible token (NFT) products based on the Fist of the North Star manga.
